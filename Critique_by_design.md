# Data Visualization Critique
In this chart, I see a large blue slope, showing that iPhone sales are rising steadily by a large margin. Besides that, the chart doesn't have any other useful information. The advantage of this chart is that it's beautiful and concise, easy to understand, and it can grab the audience's attention quickly. However, its disadvantages outweigh its advantages. First, the chart is very misleading. The chart shows cumulative iPhone sales rather than annual or quarterly iPhone sales, which can give readers the illusion of ever-increasing phone sales. The truth, however, is that iPhone sales even declined during the quarter, but that information isn't being presented in this chart. Second, the chart does not have any numbers and scale. We don't know how much the sales volume is, ten thousand? one million or even one hundred million? In order to make this chart clearer and more informative, I will use the bars to represent the annual mobile phone sales, and add the volume of sales. Also, I will represent cumulative iPhone sales with a line. I will add a legend to distinguish the cumulative sales and annual sales.
