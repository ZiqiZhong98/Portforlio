The charts above show the debt to gdp ratio of different countries from 1995 to 2021.


# The Scatter Point Chart

The chart above shows the debt to gdp ratio of different countries over years using scatter points.

In these three visualizations, the bar chart shows the debt to gdp ratio of different countries in one specific year. The grid of line charts show the changes of the debt of different countries from 1995 to 2021. The scatter point chart shows the minimum, maximum, and average debt of different countries over these years. 

I think the first chart presents the debt situation of different countries in the same year directly and visually. The second chart highlights the changes and trends in the debt situation of different countries in recent years. The second chart covers more comprehensive information, but also requires audiences to spend more time analyzing and digesting the chart. The third chart presents the overall debt situation of different countries from a statistical point of view, such as the highest value, the lowest value and the average value etc.
