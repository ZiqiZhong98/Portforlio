- What is this chart about?

The first thing I see is the word "women", so I think this is a visualization about some statistics about women, probably topic about gender inequality in workspace. The first chart is the labor participation rate between male and female. The graph is very intuitive, clearly show that male have higher labor participation rate of all time. But I also wonder the source of the data, and also if the trend changes in 2020 - 2022. 

- What do you think is the target audience?

I think the audience is the policy decision maker or the campaign audience that want to address the issue for gender inequality in workspace.

- Are there any places you find awkward or confusing?

I think the tone for the text is pretty agitated, which make me wonder whether the graphs and data are objective and unbiased. 

- Are there any places you find me doing well or bad?

Well: I can definately see the story and how the graph support the stories
Bad: Some of the graphs need more fine tuned to be more intuitive
