## Male, 23 years old, student
- what do you see and capture at first sight? What is this chart about?

I think is the Earning gap, I can see the gap is huge, but I think the bar chart with two category would be better visualization here since it is not necessary continuous, but I got the point. 

- What do you think is the target audience?

I think the audience is the policy decision maker or the campaign audience that want to address the issue for gender inequality in workspace.

- Are there any places you find awkward or confusing?

I think the tone for the text is pretty agitated, which make me wonder whether the graphs and data are objective and unbiased. 

- Are there any places you find me doing well or bad?

Well: I can definately see the story and how the graph support the stories
Bad: Some of the graphs need more fine tuned to be more intuitive


## Female, 23 years old, student

- what do you see and capture at first sight? What is this chart about?

The first thing I see are women. I see the huge wage gap beween male and female 

- What do you think is the target audience?

I think the audience are girls.

- Are there any places you find awkward or confusing?

There is no label for the number in the labor force participation of men and women with children graph, so it is hard to calculate the number.

Well: Beautiful slides, it looks very pretty.

## Female, 42 years old, lawyer

- what do you see and capture at first sight? What is this chart about?

The first thing I see is the word "women", so I think this is a visualization about some statistics about women, probably topic about gender inequality in workspace. The first chart is the labor participation rate between male and female. The graph is very intuitive, clearly show that male have higher labor participation rate of all time. But I also wonder the source of the data, and also if the trend changes in 2020 - 2022. 

- What do you think is the target audience?

I think the audience are all males and females

- Are there any places you find awkward or confusing?

For the Employment rate of men and women with different marital status, I wish there is number for the difference between men and women so that I don't have to calculate it in my head myself.

- Are there any places you find me doing well or bad?

I really like this story. but I think using transparent background of the charts can look prettier.
