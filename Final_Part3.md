# Changes since Part2
In part 2, I identified that my target audience should be all women, I hope to encourage them to pursue better education and careers. The audience also includes married men, I hope they can help their wives share more housework.

I have changed the following parts based on the interviews and the feedback from assignment.
- I changed the visulization of earning gap from stacked area chart to line chart. I found that the stacked earning gap was confusing to the audience. The stacked area chart may exaggerate the gender pay gap. The line chart is better to show the changes of earnings by gender.
- I added some transitions to make the story more coherent. Some interviewees felt my story lacked coherence. There were gaps between different paragraphs, which makes it difficult for audience to follow the entire story. So I added some transitional paragraphs to help the audience understand the whole story better.
- I changed the data and the visualizations of the education part. At first, I only visualized the education and earnings of female, and didn't include the educational attainment data of male. I added the educational attainment data of male so the comparison between male and female is easier to understand.
- I dropped the visualization of unemployment rate to make the story more clearly. Some interviewees thought the unemployment rate chart was very confusing in the whole story. So I chose to drop this part.
